# Digital Design Methods (DDM)

The contents of the three-semester series include basic techniques of data collection, transformation and modelling as well as methods for visualisation and verification of designs.

The first semester focuses on the basic and advanced knowledge of the Rhino-Grasshopper system and the QGIS tool. The former is a platform that has been universally accepted by the design community for its parametric modelling and programming capacities, while the latter serves as a common approach to accquire public available geographic data for design use.
