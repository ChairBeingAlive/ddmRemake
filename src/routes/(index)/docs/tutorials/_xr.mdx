# Mixed Reality

*This webpage houses the archival tutorials focused on visualizing digital contents within a virtual reality environment. While these modules are not part of the current course structure, there exists potential for their reintroduction in forthcoming iterations. We retain these materials for their continued relevance and prospective utility.*

## Rhino to VR
To view digital contents in a XR environment, the content needs to be transferred into a XR equipment through [Unity](https://unity.com) software (the current "standard" software for processing XR contents).

We need to build a bi-directional data transmission pipeline between Rhino and Unity for our purpose.
