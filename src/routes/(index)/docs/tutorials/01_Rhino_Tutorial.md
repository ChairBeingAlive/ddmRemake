## Rhino Basics

First of all. The Help tool (you can also press `F1`) in Rhino is very well done
and very complete. Don't hesitate to use it.

### Interface

Modeling in 3‑D is the process of creating a mathematical representation of an
object’s surfaces. The resulting model is displayed on your screen as a
two-dimensional image. Rhino provides tools for creating, displaying, and
manipulating these surfaces.

![02_Viewport_Overview.png](/ddmImg/Rhino_02_Viewport_Overview.png)

> 1. Viewport (Display different views within the graphics area)
> 2. Menu Bar (Access commands, options and document properties (e.g. model
>    units))
> 3. Tool Bar (Basic Modelling tools)
> 4. Status Bar (Displays options, toggles, coordinates)
> 5. Panels (Displays specific options such as layers, object properties,
>    cameras etc.)
> 6. Add Layout (Add set views or layouts to fast navigate btw. viewports)
> 7. Command Prompt (List of commands and prompts)

### Viewports

![Viewport_Toggle](/ddmImg/Rhino_03_Viewport_Toggle.png)

> You can reset the viewport by clicking the “Viewport Toggle" icon

Viewports are windows in the graphics area that display views of your model.
They can be docked or floating. You can customize the viewports and their
positions to suit your preferences. The size and position of viewports is
adjustable; they can be any rectangular size and shape. Each viewport has its
own construction plane and grid that the cursor normally moves on and a
projection mode. To toggle between a small viewport and one that fills the
graphics area, double-click the viewport title.

![Detail Switching the Panels](/ddmImg/Rhino_04_Change_Viewports.png)

> bottom left._

### Navigation

![Marked Navigation Tool Bar](/ddmImg/Rhino_05_Navigation.png)

> There are several types of navigation tools, which you can find in the toolbar
> above

Working in 3D on a computer requires visualizing 3D objects drawn on a 2D
medium - the computer screen. Rhino provides tools to help do this. Rhino’s easy
view navigation helps you visualize your model. You can look at you model from
any direction, look at the whole model, or look into the details. You can also
change your view in the middle of performing a command to see precisely where
you want to select an object or pick a point.

#### Mouse Navigation

![Mouse Navigation](/ddmImg/Rhino_06_Navigation_Zoom_In.png)

> 1. Pan - In viewports with parallel projections (for example: Top, Front, and
>    Right), drag with the right mouse button. In perspective viewports, hold
>    the Shift key, and drag with the right mouse button.
> 2. RotateView (Orbit) - In perspective viewports, drag with the right mouse
>    button.
> 3. Zoom - Hold the Ctrl key, and drag up and down with the right mouse button,
>    or use the mouse wheel.

![Mouse Navigation](/ddmImg/Rhino_07_Navigation_Zoom_In_Extended.png)

> 1. Zoom Extents - Zooms the view to show all objects currently visible.
> 2. Zoom Selected - Zooms the view to show all selected objects.
> 3. Undo View - The UndoView command reverses recent view changes.
> 4. Undo a command - On the Edit menu, click Undo. Or press the “Ctrl + Z”
>    keys.
> 5. Hide / Show - The Hide command conceals selected objects from view. To show
>    again: Rightclick and “Show Objects”
> 6. Fly out toolbar - Tools with a little triangle have a flyout toolbar
>    options to complete similar tasks in different ways.

### Display Modes

![Mouse Navigation](/ddmImg/Rhino_08_Display_Mode_Toolbar.png)

> You can either change the display mode by toggling the icon above or
> rightclick the >viewport title.

![Mouse Navigation](/ddmImg/Rhino_09_Changing_Displaymode.png)
![Mouse Navigation](/ddmImg/Rhino_11_Display_Modes.png)

> You can view your model in a variety of wireframe, shaded and rendered methods
> that depend >on your needs.

![Mouse Navigation](/ddmImg/Rhino_10_Changing_Viewportprotection.png)

> The perspective viewport projection can be parallel, three-point perspective,
> or two-point perspective. The viewport projection is set in Viewport
> Properties. When no object is selected, the Properties panel shows viewport
> properties.

### Units

![Mouse Navigation](/ddmImg/Rhino_12_Acess_Units.png)

> You can access the units properties through the File Menu (File > Properties >
> Units)

![Mouse Navigation](/ddmImg/Rhino_13_Document_Properties.PNG)

> As soon as Rhino is launched, you are prompted to choose the units of the
> model you will be working in. For general landscape modelling we recommend to
> choose "Meters", for CNC Milling the unti of choice should be "Millimeters".

### Basic Modeling

![Mouse Navigation](/ddmImg/Rhino_14_Commandbar.png)

> Rhino is a command-driven program. In other words, all actions are activated
> by named commands.

Toolbars contain graphical icons for initiating commands. Many toolbar icons
have a second command that can be accessed by right-clicking the icon. The
tooltip that appears when you hover over the icon tells you what the left and
right mouse button would lead to.

![Mouse Navigation](/ddmImg/Rhino_15_Lines.png)

> 1. Point(s) - Point objects mark a single point in 3‑D space. They are the
>    simplest objects in Rhino.
> 2. Line - The Line command draws one line segment.
> 3. Polyline - The Polyline command draws a series of lines.
> 4. Curve - The Curve command draws a curve from control points.

_Tips: You can **just start typing**, there is no need to press on the command
prompt. To confirm the command you can press spacebar or enter or right-click
You can also **repeat the last command** by press either spacebar, enter or
rightclick (on viewport). **To Cancel** stuff, just press ESC_

![Mouse Navigation](/ddmImg/Rhino_16_Extended_Options.png)

> Many commands provide secondary options to allow additional options. By
> clicking on the (Vertical=No) option it will change to “YES”, allowing you to
> move your objects only in Z-Axis. These secondary options are also often
> accessible through the flying toolbar.

### Status Bar

![Mouse Navigation](/ddmImg/Rhino_18_Snap_Options_2.png)

###### Object Snap (OSNAP)

![Mouse Navigation](/ddmImg/Rhino_19_Snap_Options_3.png)

> 1. Osnap The object snaps constrain the marker to an exact location on an
>    object such as the end of a line or the center of a circle.
> 2. End Snap to the end of a curve, line etc.
> 3. Near Snap onto a curve near the cursor location.
> 4. Point Snap to a point object or a control point of a line or curve.
> 5. Mid Snap to the midpoint of a curve, line, polyline segment etc.
> 6. Cen Snap to the center of a circle, box etc.
> 7. Int Snap to the intersection or projected intesection of curves, lines,
>    edges etc.
> 8. Perp Snap perpendicular to a curve.
> 9. Tan Snap tangent to a curve.
> 10. Quad Snap to the point on a curve that is at the max. x or y point
>     relative to the current construction plan.
> 11. Knot Snap to a knot on a curve or surface.
> 12. Vertex Snap to a mesh vertex. Your only option to snap on a mesh object.

###### Other Options

![Mouse Navigation](/ddmImg/Rhino_20_Other_Options.png)

> 1. Grid Snap Forces the Marker to snap on grid intersections.
> 2. Ortho Restricts cursor movements to the points at a specified angle from
>    the last point created. The default angle is 90 degrees. You can
>    temporarily turn this off by pressing Shift.
> 3. Planar This helps you model objects in the same projected plane by forcing
>    input to be on a plane normal to the last point you picked its imagined
>    connection to your viewport position.
> 4. SmartTrack SmartTrack™ is a system of temporary reference lines and points
>    that is drawn in the Rhino viewport.
> 5. Gumball The Gumball command displays the gumball widget on a selected
>    object facilitating move, scale, and rotate transformations around the
>    gumball origin.
> 6. Record History Records history and updates history-aware objects. With
>    history recording and update turned on, e.g. a lofted surface can be
>    changed by editing the input curves.
> 7. Project Osnap By default, 2D geometry is created on the active construction
>    plane. The project constraint ignores object snaps and pushes all the
>    geometry onto the active construction plane.
> 8. Disable Osnap The DisableOsnap command manages the state of persistent
>    object snaps to temporarily turn off persistent object snaps from the
>    control.

### Layers

![Mouse Navigation](/ddmImg/Rhino_21_Acess_Layer.png)

> You can access the Layer functions through the Edit Menu (Edit > Layers > Edit
> Layers) or >from the Tool Bar.

###### Setting up Layers

Layers are a way of grouping objects and applying certain characteristics to all
objects that have that layer assignment. Layer states include a layer name, the
color used to display the objects, and the visibility and the possibility to
lock/unlock all the objects on a layer. Objects are always created on the
current layer indicated by the little tick. Only one layer can be active at a
time. Objects may also be copied or moved to other layers later. Objects on
layers that are off are not visible in the model. Objects on locked layers
cannot be selected but can be snapped to.

### Modelling Tips

#### AutoCAD Alias Import

If you're an expert of AutoCAD, there's a way to import AutoCAD Aliases into
Rhino. You can then use the keyboard shortcuts to speeSteps:

1. Download the alias file here:
   [autocad-alias](/files/AutoCAD_alias_for_Rhino.txt)

2. Select from Menu: Tools->Options->Aliases:

   ![Aliases Import Window](/ddmImg/Rhino_17_AutoCAD_Alias.png)

3. Click "Import" and load the downloaded file.

4. Confirm with any warning of "overwritten the current aliases".

#### Popup Toolbar

Rhino's native approach to access the short-cut commands is to use the _pop-up
toolbar_. You can activate it by clicking the default middle-button on your
mouse (you need to click on the small title bar of the pop-up to make it
activated as normal menu):

![Pop-up Toolbar](/ddmImg/Rhino_26_popupToolbar.png)

In case of error, you can check the settings:

![Pop-up toolbar Setting](/ddmImg/Rhino_25_popupSetting.png)

By pressing _ctrl_ key and left-click-drag on any icon from the other toolbars,
you can added the tool to this pop-up toolbar and access it quickly with your
middle button:

You can add more buttons as you become more familiar with the modelling process
in Rhino and make your personalized popup toolbar. See an example below:
